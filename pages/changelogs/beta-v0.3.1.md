Hey y'all!
We just released a minor update to PSS with a few bug fixes and a few changes. Hope you enjoy!

## New
- Added ``/allowhoerightclick`` to enable hoes right clicking for a short period of time
- Added the PSS logo to the OneConfig menu

## Changes
- ``/pss`` will now open the config menu as well as printing to help command (request from narct)
- ``/pss``, and ``/pssh`` will now accurately display the complete list of commands automatically
- Added option to manage the End of Farm Notifier chime cooldown
- Remade the command system so it is easier and simpler to add more commands
- Fixed more typos

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed NullPointerException and crash when item had incorrect item data
- Fixed the composter that Hypixel broke in the latest update
- Fixed the bit shop not showing anything when the request speed was set too low
- Fixed issue with perm party manager where the data could become corrupted, preventing game from starting up

- Probably added bugs to fix later
