# Beta v0.1

A few months ago I made a post asking what features you guys wanted in a Skyblock mod. Well, over the past several months, I've compiled a few of your suggestions into a mod. I'm proud to release Partly Sane Skies, a new, 100% open source, 100% free Skyblock mod for 1.8.9.
The mod has tons of features and more are on the way.

If you find any bugs, have any suggestions or feature requests, need help from an admin or would like to stay up to date with any future updates, join our discord server We will probably be releasing an initial bug fixes update in the coming weeks, so make sure to stay up to date. As with all Skyblock mods, this mod is also use at your own risk.

Here are a few examples of features:
- Custom Main Menu
  Upon start up of Minecraft, a nice, Skyblock themed main menu will display. There are various configurable options from Skyblock-themed backrounds, along with an option to select a random background.
- Party Manager
  Manage your party and join dungeons with a helpful party manager, with features such as viewing stats, kicking, party transfer buttons, and etc. Included in the Party Manager GUI. You can open it by typing the command /pm or by using the keybind. Default: M
- Perm Party Selector
  Automatically parties everyone in a permanent dungeon party. Using /pp or /permparty, you have the option to create, party, delete, and add and remove members from your permanent party.
- Enhanced Auction Menu and BIN Sniper
  A brand new auction house menu that gives you more information on prices, instant inflation, and mark up. Using that information, the menu highlights BIN items that are significantly below their value (Default: 13% below).
- Garden Shop Trade Cost
  Shows you information about the garden shop trades.
- Top Crops to Compost
  Shows you information about which crops are the best to use for the composter at the current moment in time
