# Custom Main Menu

Upon start up of Minecraft, a nice, Skyblock themed main menu will display.
There are various configurable options from Skyblock-themed backgrounds,
along with an option to select a random background.

There is an option to select a custom image, by placing it in the config folder of your game.
By placing an image in this location: ``/config/partly-sane-skies/background.png``, you can select your own custom image 
to display, including the Windows Vista background or the Lober image.
