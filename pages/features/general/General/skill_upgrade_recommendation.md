# Mods Checker
A helpful command to help recommend what skill you should work on, calculated on how much weight each skill would provide when leveling up.  
*(Note: Sometimes, low level skills such as alchemy will show up first. These skills are less important but due to the mathematical approach, they will appear first.)*
