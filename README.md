![OwO Wanguage](images/owowangauge.png)

### Incorrect Pet for Minion Alert

If you do not the right pet selected for leveling up minions, you will be warned so that you never lose any pet EXP because you still have your level 100 dungeon pet activated. An optional World War II (1939-1945) air raid siren can be activated.

### Dungeon Player Rater

At the end of the dungeon, the mod will calculate what percentage of the dungeon was cleared by each player,
and how much they contributed, showing you how useful each player was.
In a perfectly balanced 5-player party, each player should get 20%.

### Required Secrets Notifier

Your teammates are throwing because they don't know you don't need 100% of secrets on lower floors? This feature sends a warning to yourself with a banner and sound (which can be an air raid siren) and a party message for your teammates.
