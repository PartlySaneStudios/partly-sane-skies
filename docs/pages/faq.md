# Frequently asked questions

1. **Why does the Modchecker not support certain mods?
> - Mods like OneConfig or Essentials, which release Shadow-Updates with no clear versioning, are not supported by the Modchecker. This is because the Modchecker relies on the versioning of mods to determine if they are outdated or not.
> - PolyPatcher, while basically being a different mod of Patcher, still uses the same ModId as Patcher. This makes the Modchecker unable to differentiate between the two mods, and thus, PolyPatcher is not supported by the Modchecker.
> - If you still know mods that are not yet supported, or you are certain of are outdated, please let us know in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/v4PU3WeH7z)!
