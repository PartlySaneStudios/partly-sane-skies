Hey all!
We just released a new update to Partly Sane Skies with tons of new features! 

Be sure to join the Discord as we have lots of announcements coming!

# New Features:

+ Custom sounds for skyblock 🔮
Instead of the normal noteblocks, there is now the option to use computer generated, discord sounds or even live instruments to play sounds such as Skyblock music and sound effects.

+ Best Bit Shop Profit 🪙
A lot of people use the bits accumulated from booster cookies to convert to items to sell on the auction house. Instead of having to guess which items are the best and for what price, it will now recommend to you the items that sell for the most coins per bit.

+ Best Skymart Profit 🥬
Shows which items are the most profitable for the copper cost. Which ones have the most coins per copper

+ Notification when you've reached the end of the farm 🥬
Create a region where you will be notified when you reach it, using the same commands as world edit

+ Dungeon Player Rater☠️
At the end of the dungeon, the mod will calculate what percentage of the dungeon was cleared by each player, and how much they contributed, showing you how useful each player was. In a perfectly balanced 5 player party, each player should get 20%

+ Added Enhanced Statistics 🔮
We are now able to see more information on what the mod use is like, to further enhance our features and schedule.

# Additions to existing features:

+= Arrows Count☠️
Shows the player's total arrow count in party manager and highlights the players that have low arrows. Optionally sends a message in chat to warn them

+= Ability to turn of party manager errors in chat☠️
Added the ability to turn off the error in chat that shows when the party manager fails to load a member

+= Auto load members on party join☠️
Loads the data of the members in advance in order to save time while using Party Manager (on by default)

Right clicking on icons will now correctly cycle back the icons
