# Beta v0.4
Hey everyone! We just release a new update to Partly Sane Skies with a few new features and a remake to the controversial Auction House Menu.

## New
- Mining Events Reminder (@j10a1n15)
  - The mining events reminder has a selective list of all dwarven mines & crystal hollows events. These events can be enabled separately. You can be reminded with either a banner or a banner and sound. You can choose the banner's color and display time yourself. You can also get reminded 20 seconds before the event starts.

- OwO Wanguage (@j10a1n15)
  - This feature basically changes all chat messages to use the owo language. Please don't use this; it literally breaks the chat completely. If you do, be warned.

- Added Pickaxe ability Reminder (@j10a1n15)
  - Not always aware when the pickaxe cooldown is over? Not anymore! With the new pickaxe cooldown reminder, this won't happen anymore. Need a banner? We have that! Want color in it? It's already available! Sound? Of course. It also includes PTSD, the best feature of it all—the Air Raid Siren! You can also block right-clicks on your private island, so you'll never accidentally pickoboculus your island again.

- Added required secrets notifier (@j10a1n15)
  - Your teammates are throwing because they don't know you don't need 100% of secrets on lower floors? This feature sends a warning to yourself with a banner and sound (which can be an air raid siren) and a party message for your teammates.

## Changes

- Converted all systems to the new banner renderer (@Su386yt)
- Converted most code to use "§", and changed color coordination (@RayDeeUx)
- Fixed incorrect capitalisation of SkyBlock (@j10a1n15)
- **__Custom Auction House Menu Revamp (@Su386yt)__**
  - After a ton of comments, Reddit posts, and Forum posts of people complaining how horrifying our custom auction house was, we decided to make it slightly less horrifying. We've remade it and made a few changes:
  - **By default, the auction house is now smaller**
  - By default, the FurfSky Textures are used
  -   The BIN sniper highlighting is more visible, 
  - The BIN sniper now supports a chroma accent color
  - The BIN sniper highlighting is now rounded
  - The Auction House shouldn't crash anymore (theoretically)
  - **Nearly every aspect is customisable**
