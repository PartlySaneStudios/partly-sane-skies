# Beta v0.2.1

Hey all!
We just released a new update to Partly Sane Skies with a few bug fixes and minor changes!

Be sure to join the Discord as we have lots of announcements coming!

_Note: The legacy version of this mod still requires EssentialMod and runs on Vigilance. This version will not be guranteed to be supported anymore. You are highly recommended to use the Oneconfig (normal) version of the mod._

## IF YOU ARE USING SKYCLIENT:
**If you are using skyclient, you will need to turn on the "beta features" toggle in the skyclient updater in order to get the latest version of this mod.**
**The steps to do this are as follows:**
1. Run the command /skyclientupdater
2. Enable the option titled "Enable Skyclient Beta"

# New Features
+ Added Oneconfig 🔮
  This mod now uses the new config system named Oneconfig. Unfortunately a lot of your settings have been reset, however we hope this provides a better experience overall. Because of this, the main version of this mod no longer requires the EssentialMod.

_Note: If you use the legacy (Essential based) version of this mod (highly not recomended), you will have to use the EssentialMod._
