# Beta v0.5 

Hey everyone! We just release a new update to Partly Sane Skies with a few new game features, and two big features aimed at player privacy and security!

## New
+ Mods Checker (@hannibal002 and @Su386yt)
    - This automatically checks your mods folder, to find outdated, unknown or suspicious mods. These mods have not been added to the trusted mods list and could potentially be malicious.
    - **This only works if we have the data for all official mods, so if you believe a mod is being falsely flagged as unknown, please report it in the PSS discord! (Ingame Command ``/pssdiscord``)**
    - ![image](https://github.com/PartlySaneStudios/partly-sane-skies/assets/83100266/18b5977a-c6b6-4f83-80bf-61b6a1297946)
+ Privacy Mode (@j10a1n15 and @Su386yt)
    - This blocks known mods from automatically sending your diagnostics data to their servers.
+ Healer Alert (@FlagHater)
    - Worried about your dungeon teammate dying because healer was too busy to check players' heath? Not anymore! With healer alert, a warning banner appears when a player is low on heath, saving you from losing your S+ run for the umpteenth time!!
+ Clear PSS Data Command ``/updatepssdata``
    - Automatically updates all PSS data with the latest repo
+ Fun Fact on Main Menu (@j10a1n15)
    - Ever felt like, life wasn't fun anymore? Not anymore! With the new fun fact on main menu feature, your life will be better than it ever was!
+ ``/coins2cookies`` (@RayDeeUx)
    - Converts a given amount of coins into an equivalent value in booster cookies and an IRL currency of your choice.
    - Checks your networth if given no amount.
