  - A visually pleasing treecapitator cooldown that takes inspiration from 1.9+ attack indicator to display the time remaining on the treecapitator cooldown (more cooldowns will probably be on the way I just need ideas)
  - Monkey Pet support
  - Rounded corners
  - No enchantment glint
  - 2.7/5 stars on yelp

  - Tired of monkes slacking in dungeon but too socially awkward to call them out? Well the PSS dungeon slacker can do it for you. With the included prefix, you can even use the excuse "sorry its automatic"
- Added option to hide up-to-date mods in the mod checker (@j10a1n15)
- Revamped debug mode (@Su386yt)

  - Literally only nerds care about this, but it should be more clear now what Debug mode does
- Added **Pre-release** update channel (@Su386yt)
  - A bit of an experiment, but PSS will now be releasing pre-release builds. They will be accessible through Partly Sane Skies' pre-release channel, and through SkyClient's beta updater
  - Partly Sane Skies: Do ``/pssc`` and switch ``Update Channel`` to ``Pre-release``. You should also turn on ``Use Beta Versions`` in the mod checker
  - SkyClient: Do ``/scu`` and turn on ``Enable Skyclient Beta``
- Pet alert now displays the pet level and rarity (@Su386yt)
